            <p>Translating business is not about delivering your words to the customer. It's all about delivering intention. Many business failed in a market merely because the intention was lost in translation. The words are there, but the meanings are not.</p>
            <p>There are many things promised by translators when you are looking to hire them. You will hear lots of promises. Fancy translation software. Cool office space. Satisfaction guaranteed. Fast delivery. But one thing is forgotten. Your users' or customers' satisfaction. </p>
            <p> Fancy gizmo, website, app, product, etc. will no longer fancy if your users or customers don't really understand what they are all about. That's the main reason we are here. To make sure your customers get you. To make sure your users understand you.</p>
